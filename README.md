# FlutterFire_BoilerPlate_2021
Initial set up for Flutter v2+ with FireStore set up

Contains a working Android Studio project with all the appropriate dependencies and basic list loading structure

Note! Need to add your own google-services.json file for your own FireStore database. May need adjustments based on that.
